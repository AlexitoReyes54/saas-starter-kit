Hey there, friend! I’m reaching out from the forgotten corners of the internet to share a little gem I’ve stumbled upon after getting lost in the world of manual testing. Today, let’s dive into why bug bashes are the unacknowledged elephant in the room when it comes to testing.

You see, as developers (myself included), we’re like artists perfecting a canvas—we’ll tweak and optimize the same feature until it’s a well-oiled machine. But when it’s time to test, the excitement fizzles out faster than a flat soda, doesn’t it?

We might run our unit tests—or at least we pretend to. I’m veering off-track, but the truth is, testing isn’t exactly at the top of most developers' “can’t-wait-to-do” list. There's this recurring scenario where we rush to build and ship features, and somehow, the nastiest bugs slip past the very person who coded them in the first place. If you’re lucky enough to have a QA team, they’re usually the ones playing whack-a-mole with those bugs. But in more “humble” companies, it might be another developer who catches them, or worse—a user. (Yikes. Good luck with that.) 

But what if I told you there’s a practice that sniffs out a swarm of issues, costs next to nothing, and provides as many perspectives as there are people in your team? That’s what bug bashes are all about.

## Wait, what on earth is a bug bash?

Picture this: your whole team—developers, testers, product managers, designers, writers, customer support reps, marketers—all dropping their usual to-dos and diving headfirst into testing a specific piece of software. It’s like everyone grabs a flashlight and searches every dusty corner of the codebase, hunting down bugs and providing feedback. Each person brings their own perspective and use cases, uncovering flaws that would’ve otherwise stayed hidden.

But let’s be clear—this isn’t some magic solution that replaces your testing environment. And it’s not something you should be doing every other Tuesday. Bug bashes usually happen when a shiny new feature is about to roll out, when there’s a mountain of code changes waiting to hit production, or when something major is shifting within the project.

This isn’t about mindlessly repeating tests on the same old login screen for the twentieth time. No, these sessions need focus and purpose. Everyone involved should be tuned into the goal: ensuring the new feature meets expectations as closely as possible.

## Don’t shy away from finding bugs.

I’ve met folks who get this knot in their stomach whenever they uncover a bug, almost like they’re afraid someone’s going to point fingers. Sure, a bug might hint that something went sideways during development, but the real priority is delivering the cleanest product possible. The mission isn’t about guarding egos or chasing perfection in someone’s code. Finding bugs is just a chance to make things right.

So here’s my advice: rally your team, dive into a manual testing session, and see what crawls out from under the rug. Give it a shot and let me know how it goes. I bet you’ll unearth all those sneaky bugs that someone thought they’d cleverly hidden away.

*Until next time—thanks for sticking around!*
