If you want to save yourself the trouble of reading the entire blog, the answer is no, my friend, and for a very obvious reason: we need to talk about context before discussing actions. Everything we do is based on context, and the same applies to bug bash sessions. You can’t build a house with just a shovel; you need hammers, screwdrivers, or welding equipment.

When it comes to conducting a bug bash, the correct process starts by asking ourselves: what are we going to test? For example, if we’re testing a mobile app, it’s necessary to send the app to the participants, which requires clear communication with the invitees, as well as knowing what devices they have available—whether Android or iOS. The tools used to report bugs are also not set in stone. Many teams use Excel to log the bugs they find during the bug bash, while others prefer Miro because they like a more visual form of feedback and don’t prioritize screenshots as much.

Other teams are more technical and use specialized software to report bugs, like Jam.dev, to record their findings.

The takeaway I want you to have is that there’s no one right way. First, ask yourself: what am I going to test and with whom? Then, start putting the pieces of the puzzle together; everything falls into place afterward.

Thank you for your attention. Until next time!
